<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p> This is Xinyu's page. 
<br />
Xinyu Zhang is a wannabe linguist at large, who currently studies at <a href="https://https://www.uva.nl/en">University of Amsterdam</a>
<br />
Everything is still very primitive here. But I'm working on it. Check back often!

<li>I am (and will be for a while) plotting Dutch sibilants. Shoot me a message if you have thoughts on predictors besides CoG</li>
