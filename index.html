<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p> This is Xinyu's page. 
<br />
Xinyu Zhang is a wannabe linguist at large, who currently studies at <a href="https://https://www.uva.nl/en">University of Amsterdam</a>
<br />
Everything is still very primitive here. But I'm working on it. Check back often!
<br />
<hr />
You can contact me at xinyu.zhang1[at]student.uva.nl (yes there is a "one" in the address, and a dot. One too many Xinyus)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have a presentation at <a href="https://www.let.rug.nl/tabudag/schedule.php">TABU Dag 2019</a> that I worked on with <a href="http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/">Rob van Son</a> on vowel space shift after treatment of oral cancer </li>
<li>I am (and will be for a while) plotting Dutch sibilants. Shoot me a message if you have thoughts on predictors besides CoG</li>
<li>I currently have very little brain left due to the overheating. <br />To the extent of selecting one line in a sent email and trying to delete it and doubting that the delete key is broken, <br />and writing ungrammatical sentences such as this one, <br />and leaving the room to get water in the stairwell and forgot which floor I was on on my way back</li>
</ul>
  
<p><strong>un-peer-reviewed but repllicatable findings:</strong></p>
<br/>
  <ul>
<li>Xinyu can't speak sensible English when she doesn't get enough sleep. Sentences and paragraphs come out like worse-than-verbal-diarrhea chunks. Think of Broca's aphasia minus the semantics and Wernicke's aphasia minus the fluency. Feeding coffee does not produce significantly different results.</li>
<li>Rubber bands don't obey <em>The law of conservation of mass</em>. They occasionally decide to vanish into think air even if you hang them on a hook.
  </ul>
