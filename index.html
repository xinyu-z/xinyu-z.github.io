    	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
    	<img title="Guess what this says!" src="spectrogram.png" alt="some spectrogram" width="1500" height="300">
    	<p> This is Xinyu's page.</p>
    	</br>
    	Xinyu Zhang currently studies at <a href="https://https://www.uva.nl/en">University of Amsterdam</a>
    	</br>
	<p></hr>You can reach me at xinyu.zhang1[at]student.uva.nl</hr></p>
    	<p>The prescriptive pronunciation of my name [ɕin55.ɥy21], but I really don't mind if you get creative about it. Siri has been calling me ['zi:naiu] since forever and I never even correct her.</p>
    	<h2>Update:</h2>
    	<ul>
     		<li>I have a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sYRAoyJ1fiBQaxDbEcosLbsPIdXS3gyU/view"> poster presentation</a> at <a href=https://www.let.rug.nl/tabudag/index.php>TABU Dag 2019</a> on vowel space shift after treatment of oral cancer, that I worked on with <a href="http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/">Dr. Rob van Son</a></li>
      		<li>I am (and will be for a while) plotting Dutch sibilants. Shoot me a message if you have thoughts on predictors besides CoG, or thoughts on a phonetic space for fricatives in general.</li>
    		<li> I recently started playing the Otamatone and the Kalimba. Contact me if you want to do something fun togeter (I also took piano lessons between the age of 5 and 10 so that's an option too)!</li>
	</ul>
		<br>
		<h2>Party tricks:</h2>
		<p>by me
		<ul>
			<li>Praat sings Happy Birthday <a href="PraatSingsHappyBDay_XinyuZhang.praat"> download link</a> (save it with a <code>.praat</code> extension and double-click and <code>run</code> in Praat)</li>
			<li>An R script that generates participant/appointment-specific email replies (to appear here soon).
		</ul>
		<br>
	
    		<h2>Preliminary Results in the sibilant study:</h2>
    		<p>Below are some preliminary findings from my study on the acoustic and auditory dispersion of voiceless sibilants in Dutch. But this is only primitive since I still need to control for vowels and other factors.</p>
		<p><a href="new.pdf"> Here<a/>'s some occasionally updated work in progress. I'm still trying to figure out how to automate this by Git.
    		<p>Participants: Thank you for your participation! I wouldn't be able to finish my paper without you. You will be emailed your participant ID soon so you can see which circles you are on the graphs.</p>
    		<br>
    		<h3>Acoustic distance between [ɕ] and [s] in each participant, separated by age group:</h3>

    			<figcaption>Speakers aged between 18-30, Center of Gravity on X-axis, standard deviation of the peak on Y-axis</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
    			<img src="CoG-StdevO.png" alt="Center of Gravity on X-axis, standard deviation of peak on Y-axis" width="800" height="400">
    			<figcaption>Speakers aged above 60, Center of Gravity on X-axis, standard deviation of the peak on Y-axis</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>The red and blue circles in the above plot for older speakers have more overlap than in the first plot for young speakers.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Eigenvectors 1-3 in the Principal Component Analysis:</h3>
		<p>“Elements” in the following plots refer to frequency bins in the long-term-average-spectra (bin width = 250 Hz, LTAS range = 550 - 10000 Hz).<p/>
		<img src="Eigenvector1.png" alt="Eigenvector1" width="600" height="300">
    		<p>So PC1 is very likely just amplitude difference.</p>

		<p>More detailed explnanation in the paper :) </p>

		<p>This^ is Maggie. The love of my life (besides the things I do with Praat), my <i>raison d'être</i> (besides the things I do with Praat), my favorite earthling, who provided me with the opportunity to learn that I am able to unconditionally love a living being so deep and so hard. Maggie turned 5 this May. I'm eternally grateful that she exists.</p>
