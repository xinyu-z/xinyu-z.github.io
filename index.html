<h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p> This is Xinyu's page.</p> 
</br>
Xinyu Zhang currently studies at <a href="https://https://www.uva.nl/en">University of Amsterdam</a>
</br>
Everything is still very primitive here. I wouldn't even call it "under construction". But I'm working on it. Check back often!
</br>
</hr>
You can contact me at xinyu.zhang1[at]student.uva.nl (yes there is a "one" in the address, and a dot. One too many Xinyus)</p>
</hr>

  <h2>Update:</h2>
<ul>
<li>I'm writing my *thing* in LaTeX. Might take longer, but it won't crash after you've inserted 10 graphs. Plus it provides some illusion of having everything under control when you can change the visual representation of your text by typing a few lines of commands.
<li>I have a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sYRAoyJ1fiBQaxDbEcosLbsPIdXS3gyU/view">presentation</a> at <a href=https://www.let.rug.nl/tabudag/index.php">TABU Dag 2019</a> on vowel space shift after treatment of oral cancer, that I worked on with <a href="http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/">Dr. Rob van Son</a></li>
<li>I am (and will be for a while) plotting Dutch sibilants. Shoot me a message if you have thoughts on predictors besides CoG.</li>
<li>I currently have very little brain left due to the heat. (But this is apparently an excuse as you will soon see things like "due to the cold" or "due to the unicorn in my dreams". Truth is I have very little brain to start with.)
</ul>
</br> 
  <h2>Non-peer-reviewed but replicable findings:</h2>

  <ul>
<li>Xinyu can't speak sensible English when she doesn't get enough sleep. Sentences and paragraphs come out like worse-than-verbal-diarrhea chunks. Think Broca's aphasia minus the semantics and Wernicke's aphasia minus the fluency. Feeding coffee does not produce significantly different results.</li>
<li>Rubber bands don't obey <em>The law of conservation of mass</em>. They occasionally decide to vanish into thin air even if you hang them on a hook.
<li>Xinyu's brain stops working as soon as she takes one bite of any cookie. Please don't feed.
  </ul> 
  
  <h2>Scripts:</h2>

  Some scripts (Praat and non-Praat) that do interesting but mostly useless things will appear here. </br>

<ul>  
  <li>An R script that semi-automates participant email replying will appear here in late July (instead of now because I have yet to modify it and because thesis). </li>
  <li>The next useless and silly but cool Praat script (which already works fine) will appear here in the later half of November. Because reasons (which will appear as the first line of said script).</li>
</ul>
