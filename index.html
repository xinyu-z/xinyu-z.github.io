    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <img title="Guess what this says!" src="spectrogram.png" alt="some spectrogram" width="1500" height="300">
    <p> This is Xinyu's page.</p>
    <p>*This page has recently been revamped for a practice job interview.</p>
    </br>
    Xinyu Zhang currently studies at <a href="https://https://www.uva.nl/en">University of Amsterdam</a>
    </br>
		<p> </hr>You can contact me at xinyu.zhang1[at]student.uva.nl (yes there is a "one" in the address, and a dot. One too many Xinyus)</hr>
    <p>My name is pronounced as [ɕin55.ɥy21], but I really don't mind if you come up with your own version. E.g. Siri has been calling me ['zi:naiu] since forever and I still love her all the same. I never even correct her.</p>
    <h2>Update:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I have a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sYRAoyJ1fiBQaxDbEcosLbsPIdXS3gyU/view"> poster presentation</a> at <a href=https://www.let.rug.nl/tabudag/index.php>TABU Dag 2019</a> on vowel space shift after treatment of oral cancer, that I worked on with <a href="http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/">Dr. Rob van Son</a></li>
      <li>I am (and will be for a while) plotting Dutch sibilants. Shoot me a message if you have thoughts on predictors besides CoG, or thoughts on a phonetic space for fricatives in general.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Preliminary Results:</h2>
    <p>Below are some preliminary findings from my study on the auditory dispersion of voiceless sibilants in Dutch.</p>
    <p>Participants: I sincerely thank you for your participation. I wouldn't be able to finish my paper without you. You will be emailed your participant ID soon so you can see which circle you are on the graphs.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Acoustic distance between [ɕ] and [s] in each participant, separated by age group:</h3>
    <img src="CoG-StdevY.png" alt="Center of Gravity on X-axis, Standard deviation of the peak on Y-axis" width="800" height="400">
    <p>Above: Speakers aged between 18-30, Center of Gravity on X-axis, Standard deviation of the peak on Y-axis</p>
    <br>
    <img src="CoG-StdevO.png" alt="Center of Gravity on X-axis, Standard deviation of peak on Y-axis" width="800" height="400">
    <p>Above: Speakers aged above 60, Center of Gravity on X-axis, Standard deviation of the peak on Y-axis</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Eigenvectors 1-4:</h3>
    <img src="Eigenvector1.png" alt="Eigenvector1" width="600" height="300">
    <p>So PC1 is very likely just amplitude difference.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="eigenvector2&3.png" alt="Eigenvectors 2 and 3" width="600" height="600">
    <br>
    <img src="Eigenvector4.png" alt="Eigenvector4" width="600" height="300">
    <br>
    <h3>Sibilants according to age group and Principal Components:</h3>
    <img src="PC1-PC2.png" alt="PC1-PC2" width="600" height="550">
    <br>
    <img src="PC2-PC3.png" alt="PC2-PC3" width="600" height="550">
    <p>If you look closely at the image above ("ɕo" = [ɕ] produced by older speakers, "ɕy" = [ɕ] produced by younger speakers, same for "sy" and "so"), the [ɕ]'s between the two age groups do not differ much but the [s]'s produced by younger speakers are gurther away from those produced by older speakers.</p>
