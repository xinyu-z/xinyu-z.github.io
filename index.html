<h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p> This is Xinyu's page.</p> 
</br>
Xinyu Zhang currently studies at <a href="https://https://www.uva.nl/en">University of Amsterdam</a>
</br>
Everything is still very primitive here. But I'm working on it. Check back often!
</br>
</hr>
You can contact me at xinyu.zhang1[at]student.uva.nl (yes there is a "one" in the address, and a dot. One too many Xinyus)</p>
</hr>

  <h2>Update:</h2>
<ul>
<li>I have a presentation at <a href="https://www.let.rug.nl/tabudag/schedule.php">TABU Dag 2019</a> on vowel space shift after treatment of oral cancer, that I worked on with <a href="http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/">Dr.Rob van Son</a></li>
<li>I am (and will be for a while) plotting Dutch sibilants. Shoot me a message if you have thoughts on predictors besides CoG</li>
<li>I currently have very little brain left due to the heat.(But this is apparently an excuse. I have very little brain to start with.)
</ul>
</br> 
  <h2>Non-peer-reviewed but replicable findings:</h2>

  <ul>
<li>Xinyu can't speak sensible English when she doesn't get enough sleep. Sentences and paragraphs come out like worse-than-verbal-diarrhea chunks. Think Broca's aphasia minus the semantics and Wernicke's aphasia minus the fluency. Feeding coffee does not produce significantly different results.</li>
<li>Rubber bands don't obey <em>The law of conservation of mass</em>. They occasionally decide to vanish into thin air even if you hang them on a hook.
<li>Xinyu's brain stops working as soon as she takes one bite of any cookie. Please don't feed.
  </ul> 
  
  <h2>Scripts:</h2>

  Some scripts (Praat and non-Praat) that do interesting but mostly useless things will appear here. </br>

<ul>  
  <li>An R script that semi-automates participant email replying will appear here in late July (instead of now because I have yet to modify it and because thesis). </li>
  <li>The next useless and silly but cool Praat script (which already works fine) will appear here in the later half of November. Because reasons.</li>
</ul>
