## Bio

Xinyu Zhang ([ɕin˥˥ɥy˨˩˦ ʈ͡ʂɑŋ˥˥]) is a linguist in training. She currently
studies at [ACLC](https://aclc.uva.nl/about/about-aclc-update.html) of [University of Amsterdam](https://https://www.uva.nl/en), under the supervision of [Dr. Rob van Son](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/) and [Dr. Paul Boersma](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/paul/). Her main areas of interest are phonetics and phonology, acoustic and articulatory phonetics, and production-perception interaction.

Her most recent research projects include a study on the cross-generation auditory dispersion of the Dutch sibilants /s/ and /ɕ/, and a study of the psychoacoustics of perceived voice qualities after the treatment of laryngeal carcinoma.

## Results from the voice quality study:

**Progress as of March 3, 2021** 

- View [slides](https://github.com/xinyu-z/xinyu-z.github.io/blob/master/MPhilThesisPresentation.pdf)

- Some highlights:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap = "Roughness as predicted by acoustic measurements"}
knitr::include_graphics("roughnessPlot.png")
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap = "De-correlated breathiness as predicted by acoustic measurements"}
knitr::include_graphics("breathinessPlot.png")
```

## Results from the sibilant study

(All participants who indicated interest in the findings on the consent form have been emailed the full results. Thank you all for donating your voices <3)

If you want to read the whole paper: [PDF](https://scripties.uba.uva.nl/search?id=c3239102). 

Otherwise, some TL;DR:

**Acoustic distance between [ɕ] and [s] in each participant, separated by age group:**

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap = "Speakers aged between 18-30, Center of Gravity on X-axis, standard deviation of the peak on Y-axis"}
knitr::include_graphics("CoG-StdevY.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap = "Speakers aged above 60, Center of Gravity on X-axis, standard deviation of the peak on Y-axis"}
knitr::include_graphics("CoG-StdevO.png")
```
The red and blue circles in the above plot for older speakers have more overlap than in the first plot for young speakers.

**Alternatively, if we run a PCA on energies by frequency bins:**

“Elements” in the following plots refer to frequency bins in the long-term-average-spectra (bin width = 250 Hz, LTAS range = 550 - 10000 Hz).
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap = "Eigenvector 1 looks like it's just amplitude difference"}
knitr::include_graphics("Eigenvector1.png")
```

If we then plot eigenvector 2 against 3 by age group:
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap = "age > 60"}
knitr::include_graphics("PC2PC3O.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap = "18< age < 30"}
knitr::include_graphics("PC2PC3Y.png")
```
We can also try some random forest!
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap = "ranking of bins in the younger speakers"}
knitr::include_graphics("youngForest.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap = "ranking of bins in the older speakers"}
knitr::include_graphics("oldForest.png")
```


## Things you didn't need to know:

If you want to get to know me a tiny bit better, here are my cardinal vowels plotted.

(I mean, what better way to get to know someone, right?)
